                        <h3>York Minster</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York</strong>, commonly
                            known as <strong>York Minster</strong>, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the
                            largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the
                            second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the
                            Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title "minster" is
                            attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and
                            serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church
                            or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.

                        <h3>York Castle</h3>
                        <p><strong>York Castle</strong> in the city of York, England, is a fortified complex comprising,
                            over the last nine centuries, a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings on
                            the south side of the River Foss. The now-ruinous keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly
                            referred to as <strong>Clifford's Tower</strong>. Built originally on the orders of William
                            I to dominate the former Viking city of York, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history
                            before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion
                            in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be
                            used as a jail and prison until 1929.

                        <p>The <strong>York Museum Gardens</strong> are botanic gardens in the centre of York, England,
                            beside the River Ouse. They cover an area of 10 acres (4.0 ha) of the former grounds of St Mary's
                            Abbey, and were created in the 1830s by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society along with the
                            Yorkshire Museum which they contain.

                        <p><strong>The Shambles</strong> (official name <strong>Shambles</strong>) is an old street in
                            York, England, with overhanging timber-framed buildings, some dating back as far as the fourteenth
                            century. It was once known as <strong>The Great Flesh Shambles</strong>, probably from the
                            Anglo-Saxon Fleshammels (literally 'flesh-shelves'), the word for the shelves that butchers used to
                            display their meat. As recently as 1872 twenty-five butchers' shops were located along the street,
                            but now none remain.
